# Applying modifiers

Another way of customizing animations in Reanimated is by using animation modifiers. You can repeat, chain, delay, and combine animations in any way you want. For this purpose Reanimated comes with three modifiers: [`withRepeat`](/docs/animations/with-repeat), [`withSequence`](/docs/animations/with-sequence), and [`withDelay`](/docs/animations/with-delay).

Let's build an animation which uses all of these modifiers and learn them along the way. Let's go!

## Shake it like it's hot

We're going make an animated box which will shake on a button press after a slight delay.

Let's start by having a simple `Animated.View` and a `Button` component on the screen:

import FirstStep from "./applying-modifiers/_snippet_1.md";

<CollapsibleCode showLines={[[1, 7]]}>
  <FirstStep />
</CollapsibleCode>

import SecondStep from "./applying-modifiers/_snippet_2.md";

<SecondStep />

We can make it animate back and forth by passing `true` to the `reverse` (third) argument.

compose your own animation which you can easily reuse in different parts of your application.

Let's see it in an interactive example:

import ModifiersShake from "@site/src/examples/ModifiersShake";

<InteractiveExample name="ModifiersShake" component={<ModifiersShake />} />
