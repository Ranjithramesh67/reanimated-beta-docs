# Customizing animations

We can tell that you're getting the hang of it! Previous sections not only taught you how to use shared values in practice but also you used [`withSpring`](/docs/animations/with-spring) and [`withTiming`](/docs/animations/with-timing) functions to create animations. We think now you're more than ready to dive deeper into customizing animations!

Reanimated includes three built-in animation functions: `withTiming`, `withSpring`, and [`withDecay`](/docs/animations/with-decay). For now, let's focus on the first two, and we'll come back to `withDecay` in the [Handling interactions](/docs/fundamentals/handling-interactions) section.

## withTiming

we can modify a shared value to create a smooth animation.

## withSpring
