# Customizing animations

Previous sections not only taught you how to use shared values in practice but also you used [`withSpring`](/docs/animations/with-spring) and [`withTiming`](/docs/animations/with-timing) functions to create animations. We think now you're more than ready to dive deeper into customizing animations!

Reanimated comes with three built-in animation functions: `withTiming`, `withSpring`, and [`withDecay`](/docs/animations/with-decay). For now, let's focus on the first two, and we'll come back to `withDecay` in the [Handling interactions](/docs/fundamentals/handling-interactions) section.

It's very easy to customize the behavior of animation functions in Reanimated. You can do this by passing a `config` object to the second parameter of either `withTiming` or `withSpring` function.

## Configuring `withTiming`

The `config` parameter of `withTiming` comes with two properties: `duration` and `easing`.

```jsx
import { withTiming, Easing } from "react-native-reanimated";

sv.value = withTiming(100, {
  duration: 300,
  easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.quad),
});
```

Simple enough, the `duration` parameter defines how long in milliseconds the animation should take to reach the assigned `toValue`. This value is set by default to `300`.

The `easing` parameter lets you fine-tine the animation over the specified time. For example, you can make the animation begin with fast acceleration and then slow it down towards the end, or start slowly then pick up some speed before slowing down again towards the end. This value defaults to `Easing.inOut(Easing.quad)`.

It all will start to make sense when you compare side by side a `linear` easing with the default easing.

<InteractiveExample
  name="TimingConfigCompare"
  component={<TimingConfigCompare />}
/>

Reanimated comes with a handful of predefined easing functions. You can find the full reference in the [`Easing`](/docs/animations/with-timing#easing) section.

## Configuring `withSpring`

`withSpring` is a physics based animation function which works way different from `withTiming`. The physics based approach makes the animations look _believable_. Most of the times when tinkering with springs you'll be adjusting of of three properties: `damping`, `mass` and `stiffness`. Reanimated comes with plenty of properties which are described in the [reference](/docs/animations/with-spring#config).

how hard is to it adds an _inertia_ to the object you're moving.

  name="SpringConfigCompare"
  component={<SpringConfigCompare />}
