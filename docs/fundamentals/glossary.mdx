# Glossary of terms

## Shared value

## Animation value

An animation value refers to a type of value that can be used for animations. These values include numbers, strings, and arrays of numbers.

String values can be animated if they are in a specific format, such as `"10deg"`, `"21%"`, or even colors like `"#ffaabb"` or `"rgba(100, 200, 100, 0.7)"`.

## Animation modifier

Animation modifiers are functions used to customize animations. They describe how the animation should behave.

Reanimated comes with a bunch of built-in modifiers:

- [`withDecay`](/)
- [`withDelay`](/)
- [`withRepeat`](/)
- [`withSequence`](/)
- [`withSpring`](/)
- [`withTiming`](/)

## Animation object

An animation object holds the current state of the animation including its start and end conditions, as well as a `onFrame` function which allows to calculate the animation state for each frame.

When you pass an animation object to a shared value it is automatically treated as an [animation value](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#animation-value).

For example, consider this code:

```javascript
sv.value = withSpring(100);
```

Even though, the `withSpring` returns an animation object the final result that is stored in a shared value is just a number.

## Snack

An [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) is a platform similar to CodeSandbox or StackBlitz allowing to run React Native apps in the browser. It's a great way to report issues with the library.
