# Glossary of terms

## Shared value

Shared Values are a driving factor of all your animations in Reanimated.

They are defined using `useSharedValue` hook:

```javascript
import { useSharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";
```

and accessed and modified by their `.value` property:

```javascript {2,5}
function App() {
  const sv = useSharedValue(0);

  const handlePress = () => {
    sv.value += 10;
  };

  // rest of your glamorous code âœ¨
}
```

When used, the data stored in Shared Value is automatically synchronized between the JS thread and the UI thread.

## Animatable value

An animatable value refers to a type of value that can be used for animations. These values include numbers, strings, and arrays of numbers.

String values can be animated if they are in a specific format, such as `"10deg"`, `"21%"`, or even colors like `"#ffaabb"` or `"rgba(100, 200, 100, 0.7)"`.

## Animation helper

Reanimated comes with 3 built-in animations:

- [`withSpring`](/)
- [`withTiming`](/)
- [`withDecay`](/)

## Animation modifier

Animation modifiers are functions used to customize animations. They describe how the animation should behave.

Reanimated comes with 3 built-in modifiers:

- [`withDelay`](/)
- [`withRepeat`](/)
- [`withSequence`](/)

## Animation object

An animation object holds the current state of the animation including its start and end conditions, as well as a `onFrame` function which allows to calculate the animation state for each frame.

When you pass an animation object to a shared value it is automatically treated as an [animatable value](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#animatable-value).

For example, consider this code:

```javascript
sv.value = withSpring(100);
```

Even though, the `withSpring` returns an animation object the final result that is stored in a shared value is just a number.

## Snack

An [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) is a platform similar to CodeSandbox or StackBlitz allowing to run React Native apps in the browser. It's a great way to report issues with the library.
