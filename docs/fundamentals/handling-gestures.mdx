# Handling gestures

## Handling tap gestures

import TapGesture from "@site/src/examples/HandlingGestures/TapGesture";
import TapGestureSrc from "!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/HandlingGestures/TapGesture";

<InteractiveExample
  src={TapGestureSrc}
  component={<TapGesture />}
  label="Tap the circle"
/>

## Handling pan gestures

import PanGesture from "@site/src/examples/HandlingGestures/PanGesture";
import PanGestureSrc from "!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/HandlingGestures/PanGesture";

<InteractiveExample
  src={PanGestureSrc}
  component={<PanGesture />}
  label="Grab and drag the square"
/>

## Using `withDecay`

remember when we said that we'll come back to `withDecay` later? Now this is the time!

import DecayBasic from "@site/src/examples/DecayBasic";
import DecayBasicSrc from "!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/DecayBasic";

<InteractiveExample
  src={DecayBasicSrc}
  component={<DecayBasic />}
  label="Grab and drag the square"
/>

## Summary

In this section, we went through basics of handling gestures with Reanimated and Gesture Handler. We learned about `Tap` and `Pan` gestures. To sum up:

## What's next?

In this article, we've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with gestures in Reanimated. Besides [Tap](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/api/gestures/tap-gesture) and [Pan](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/api/gestures/pan-gesture) gestures Gesture Handler comes with many, many more e.g. [Pinch](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/api/gestures/pinch-gesture) or [Fling](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/api/gestures/fling-gesture). We welcome you to dive into the full [React Native Gesture Handler documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/) and explore all the available gestures.

In [the next section](/docs/fundamentals/customizing-animation), we'll learn more about animating colors.
