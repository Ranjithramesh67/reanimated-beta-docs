# Handling gestures

In this section, we'll learn how to handle gestures with Reanimated. For this purpose, Reanimated makes use of a sibling library called [React Native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/).

We'll get into `Tap` and `Pan` gestures as well as the `withDecay` animation function.

Just make sure to go through the [Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/installation) installation steps first and come back here to learn how to use it with Reanimated.

## Handling tap gestures

First, let's wrap our app with `GestureHandlerRootView`. It's important to keep the [`GestureHandlerRootView`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/installation/#js) as close to the actual root view as possible.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      {/* rest of the app */}
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  );
}
```

you create and configure the gesture by using `Gesture.Tap()`.

import TapGestureSimpleSrc from "!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/HandlingGestures/TapGestureSimple";

<CollapsibleCode showLines={[11, 18]} src={TapGestureSimpleSrc} />

by wrapping the component with `GestureDetector` and passing your tap gesture the via `gesture` prop.

<CollapsibleCode showLines={[21, 29]} src={TapGestureSimpleSrc} />

import TapGestureFinal from "@site/src/examples/HandlingGestures/TapGestureFinal";
import TapGestureFinalSrc from "!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/HandlingGestures/TapGestureFinal";

<InteractiveExample
  src={TapGestureFinalSrc}
  component={<TapGestureFinal />}
  label="Tap the circle"
/>

That works great for a simple tap but what if we'd like to create something a bit more interesting?

## Handling pan gestures

bouncing back to it's staring position keeping the color highlight we've added in the previous example.

import PanGestureFinal from "@site/src/examples/HandlingGestures/PanGestureFinal";
import PanGestureFinalSrc from "!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/HandlingGestures/PanGestureFinal";

<InteractiveExample
  src={PanGestureFinalSrc}
  component={<PanGestureFinal />}
  label="Grab and drag the square"
/>

## Using `withDecay`

remember when we said that we'll come back to `withDecay` later? Now this is the time!

import DecayBasic from "@site/src/examples/DecayBasic";
import DecayBasicSrc from "!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/DecayBasic";

<InteractiveExample
  src={DecayBasicSrc}
  component={<DecayBasic />}
  label="Grab and drag the square"
/>

## Summary

In this section, we went through basics of handling gestures with Reanimated and Gesture Handler. We learned about `Tap` and `Pan` gestures. To sum up:

## What's next?

In this article, we've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with gestures in Reanimated. Besides [Tap](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/api/gestures/tap-gesture) and [Pan](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/api/gestures/pan-gesture) gestures Gesture Handler comes with many more e.g. [Pinch](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/api/gestures/pinch-gesture) or [Fling](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/api/gestures/fling-gesture). We welcome you to dive into the [Quick start](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/quickstart) section of the React Native Gesture Handler documentation and explore all the possibilities that this library comes with.

In [the next section](/docs/fundamentals/customizing-animation), we'll learn more about animating colors.
