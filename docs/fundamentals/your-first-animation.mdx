# Your First Animation

In this section, we'll guide you through the basic concepts of Reanimated. If you're new to Reanimated, you're in the right hands! We're going to start by building a simple animation which will help you develop a basic understanding of the library. Then, in the following sections, we're going to built on top of this knowledge and further extend the animation. Let's go!

## Using an Animated component

Let's start by having something that we could see on the screen. First, to create an animatable component you need to import it:

```bash
import Animated from "react-native-reanimated";
```

This `Animated` component wraps React Native built-ins such as `View`, `ScrollView` or `FlatList`.

You use this component as any other JSX component:

```jsx {6}
import { StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import Animated from "react-native-reanimated";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Animated.View
      style={{
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        backgroundColor: "violet",
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

You can create your own custom animated components by using [`createAnimatedComponent`](/api/createAnimatedComponent).

## Defining a Shared Value

A [Shared Value](/learn-more/shared-value) is a driving factor of all your animations. You can think of it as a React state which is automagically kept in sync between the “JavaScript” and the “native” side of your app (hence the name). You create Shared Values using a `useSharedValue` hook:

```bash
import { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

As any [other React hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html), you have to define it in your component's body. In a Shared Value you can store any JS value like `number`, `string` or `boolean` but also data structures such as `array` and `object`.

For now, let's use `100` as the default value of the `useSharedValue` hook and pass the returned value as an inline style of the `Animated.View`:

```jsx {4,9}
import Animated, { useSharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";

export default function App() {
  const width = useSharedValue(100);

  return (
    <Animated.View
      style={{
        width,
        height: 100,
        backgroundColor: "violet",
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Using a Shared Value

Our goal is to animate a `width` of an element that will expand by `50px` on each button press. We can do this by modifying a shared value that is connected to the `width` property of a `Animated.View` component.

Shared Values are accessed and modified by their `.value` property.

There's no setter or anything - you simply mutate the `.value` property like there's no tomorrow.

Let's define a `handlePress` function in which we'll modify the shared value:

```jsx {8,20}
import { Button, View } from "react-native";
import Animated, { useSharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";

export default function App() {
  const width = useSharedValue(100);

  const handlePress = () => {
    width.value += 50;
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Animated.View
        style={{
          width,
          height: 100,
          backgroundColor: "violet",
        }}
      />
      <Button onPress={handlePress} title="Click me" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

:::caution

It's a very common mistake to try to modify a shared value directly, like using ~~`sv = sv + 100;`~~. Always remember to access the shared value by using the `.value` property instead! Here, the correct usage would be `sv.value = sv.value + 100;`.

:::

And voilà, we've made our first animation using Reanimated! You can see how it works in it's full glory in a preview below:

<InteractiveExample name="FirstAnimation" component={<FirstAnimation />} />

## Summary

Right now, the animation we made in this section may not be very exciting, but we gained a firm grasp on the fundamentals. We learned about `Animated` components and how to define and modify `Shared Values`. To sum up:

- `Animated` components are used to define animatable elements.
- Shared Values are driving factors of all animations and we define them using a `useSharedValue` hook.
- Shared Values are always accessed and modified by the `.value` property (eg. `sv.value = 100;`)

## What's next?

In [the next section](applying-modifiers), we'll learn how to make our animations a little bit more interesting by applying modifiers like spring and decay.
