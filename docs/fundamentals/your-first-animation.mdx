# Your First Animation

In this section, we will walk you through the basic concepts of Reanimated. If you're new to Reanimated, you're in the right hands! We're going to start by building a simple animation which will help you develop a basic understanding of the library. We will built on top of this and extend the animation in the following sections. Let's go!

## Using an Animated component

Let's start by having something that we could animate on the screen. You can do this by importing `Animated` from `react-native-reanimated`:

```bash
import Animated from "react-native-reanimated";
```

This component wraps React Native built-in component such as `View`, `ScrollView` or `FlatList`. As it is a default export you can name this whatever you like but we highly suggest sticking to `Animated`.

You use this component as any other JSX component like so:

```jsx {5}
import { StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import Animated from "react-native-reanimated";

export default function App() {
  return <Animated.View style={styles.box} />;
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    height: 100,
    width: 100,
    backgroundColor: "violet",
  },
});
```

You can create your own custom animated components by using [`createAnimatedComponent`](/api/createAnimatedComponent).

## Defining a shared value

All animations starts with a [shared value](/learn-more/shared-value). A shared value is a driving factor of all your animations in Reanimated. You can think of it as a state which is automagically kept in sync between “JavaScript” and “native” side of your app (hence the name).

```bash
import { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

```jsx {4, 6}
import Animated, { useSharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";

export default function App() {
  const width = useSharedValue(50);

  return <Animated.View style={{ ...styles.box, width }} />;
}
```

You can store any JS value in a shared value including arrays and JS objects.

## Using a shared value

You use shared values by referencing `.value` property. There's no setter or anything - you simply mutate the `.value` property like there's no tomorrow.

changing the width by 20% on each click.

```jsx
import { Button, StyleSheet, View } from "react-native";
import Animated, { useSharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";

export default function App() {
  const width = useSharedValue(100);

  const handlePress = () => {
    width.value = width.value * 1.2;
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Animated.View style={{ ...styles.box, width }} />
      <Button onPress={handlePress} title="Click me" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

<InteractiveExample name="FirstAnimation" component={<FirstAnimation />} />
