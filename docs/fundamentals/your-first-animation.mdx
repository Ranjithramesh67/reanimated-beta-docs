# Your First Animation

which we will expand in the following sections.

<InteractiveExample name="FirstAnimation" component={<FirstAnimation />} />

## Animated component

First, we need to have something to animate. The `Animated` component wraps React Native built-in such as `View`, `ScrollView` or `FlatList`.

```bash
import Animated from "react-native-reanimated";
```

Let's animate a simple `View` component:

```jsx {4}
import Animated from "react-native-reanimated";

export default function App() {
  return <Animated.View style={styles.box} />;
}
```

## Shared value

All animations starts with a [shared value](/learn-more/shared-value). A shared value is a driving factor of all your animations. You can think of it as a state which is automagically kept in sync between “JavaScript” and “native” side of your app (hence the name).

You use by referencing into `.value` property of the shared value.

```bash
import { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

```jsx {4, 6}
import Animated, { useSharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";

export default function App() {
  const width = useSharedValue(50);

  return <Animated.View style={{ ...styles.box, width }} />;
}
```

You can store any JS value in a shared value including arrays and JS objects.
changing the width by 20% on each click.
