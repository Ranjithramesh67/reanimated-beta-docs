# Getting started

The following `Get started` section is designed to help you build a strong foundation on the library and give you the confidence to explore more advanced use cases on your own. Are you ready? Let's dive in!

## What is React Native Reanimated?

React Native Reanimated is a powerful animation library bulit by [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/).

With this library, you can easily create smooth animations and interactions that run on the native thread.

## Installation

It takes three steps to add Reanimated to a project:

### Step 1: Install the package

Install `react-native-reanimated` package from npm:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO" default>

    npx expo install react-native-reanimated

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm install react-native-reanimated

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn add react-native-reanimated

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Add Reanimated's babel plugin

Add `react-native-reanimated/plugin` plugin to your `babel.config.js`.

```js {7}
  module.exports = {
    presets: [
      ... // don't add it here :)
    ],
    plugins: [
      ...
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
    ],
  };
```

:::caution

`react-native-reanimated/plugin` has to be listed last.

<summary>Why do I need this?</summary>
<br/>

In short, the Reanimated babel plugin automatically converts special JavaScript functions (called [worklets]('/worklets')) in a way that they could be passed and run in the UI thread.

To learn more about the plugin head onto to [Reanimated babel plugin](/docs/learn-more/reanimated-babel-plugin) section of the documentation.

### Step 3: Clear cache (recommended)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO" default>

    npx expo start -c

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm start -- --reset-cache

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn start --reset-cache

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Platform specific setup

#### Android

No additional steps are necessary.

#### iOS

While developing for iOS, you need to install [pods](https://cocoapods.org/) before running the app:

```
npx pod-install ios
```

#### Web

We highly recommend to use [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

Add [`@babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from) Babel plugin.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO" default>

    npx expo install @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn add @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```js {7}
  module.exports = {
      presets: [
        ... // don't add it here :)
      ],
      plugins: [
          ...
          '@babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from',
          'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
      ],
  };
```

More advanced use cases such as running Reanimated with `webpack` or with `Next.js` are explained in [a separate guide](/web-support).
